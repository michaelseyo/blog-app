Deployed on: https://blog-app01.netlify.app/

An app that showcases Covid-19 data together with related news. Users are able to make posts and share with the
world regarding their thoughts on the situation. Created using React, material-ui, firestore and localStorage. The News API was used to obtain the news and Covid19 API to obtain the relevant data. Still a work in progress to improve the
styling and adding on of some other features!
